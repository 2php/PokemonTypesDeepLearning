# Pokemon, Colors, and Deep Learning

## Overview

If you are reading this, I am almost certain you have heard the term Deep Learning and/or Pokemon. The former is a branch of Machine Learning that has risen in popularity in the recent years, and the latter is a franchise that has been popular since the 90â€™s and with the release of Pokemon Go everyone has been talking about it.

What is the connection with these two concepts? Out of curiosity I took on the task of attempting to predict the type or category of a given Pokemon using its appearance, in particular its color, using a Deep Learning algorithm called Convolutional Neural Network or ConvNet.

This experiment was performed using Python, the deep learning library TensorFlow version 0.10.0 and its simplified interface TF Learn.

## Project

In this repository you can find the script used for the experiment.
